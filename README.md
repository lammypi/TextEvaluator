# TextEvaluator
A basic tool I created using Mercury that calculates a readability score and some general text statistics. Calculations are derived from textstat. 


__OUTPUT__

- Aggregate readability score- combines readability score calculations across multiple reading scores, like Flesch-Kincaid and Coleman-Liau.
- Estimated time to read- how long it takes to read a text.
- Sentence count
- Letter count
